# Explore
The file explorer you probably shouldn't use


# About
Explore isn't really a file explorer. It is more of an experiment to see how hackable programs should be written.


# Ideology 

There are a few concepts I would like to follow when writing this program.

1. The user should have complete control over the placement and styling of literally everything.

2. Assume 2 kinds of users, the casual scrub, and the super configinator. Casual scrubs dont care about customization they only want their program to work. Super configinators want to customize their program to the max. When writing the application think about the background knowledge of these two users, casual scrubs know how to open a program, and that is about it. Super configinators know html, css, js, json, and basic programming.

3. Plugins and Themes. They are cool. Use them. Allow others to make them and distribute them easily.

4. Use the Git philosophy. From the book "Zero Bugs and Program Faster": "If you've worked with Git then you know that it has simple commands, like push and pull. These are commands that are designed to be simple to use, they are the human interface, but they are somewhat limited. They are called porcelain commands, because they are easy to use. Underneath the simple and limited commands are the more complex plumbing commands, which are complex enough to allow Git to do anything".
